# Immutable
Immutable / persistent data structures are well known in functional programming languages and logic programming 
languages. They provide the ability to be passed down without worrying the change of state. They simplify 
multi-threading programming because they can be passed down to many threads without the risk of race condition. Although
 good programmers could implement the same functionality without immutable data structures, in fact, more efficient, 
 some programming languages require immutability by design.
